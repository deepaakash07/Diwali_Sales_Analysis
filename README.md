# The Diwali Sales Analysis project aims to utilize linear regression techniques to gain insights into the sales performance during the Diwali festival season. By employing historical sales data, the project will create a predictive model to forecast sales figures based on various factors like marketing expenditure, promotional activities, and seasonal trends. Moreover, to enhance the accuracy of the model, outlier detection and removal techniques will be applied to eliminate data points that deviate significantly from the norm. This process will ensure a more robust and reliable analysis, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions and optimize their sales strategies for the upcoming Diwali festivities.
